<p>Data Scientist with five years of experience. I am passionate about statistics, artificial intelli- gence, signals and programming. My main interest consists in audio projects such as speech to text projects, speech recognition, audio generation, audio sentiment analysis, emotion re- cognition, etc. 
    But I enjoy working with any project that let me improve my knowledge about artificial intelligence. My abilities include analyzing and solving classification, prediction and recognition problems using tools such as Deep learning and Machine learning. I am able to create big data pipelines. I am able to work with all the AI life cycle: researching, developing, deploying and maintenance. 
    I am proficient in Python and Iâ€™m trained in cloud infrastructures such as AWS or GCP. I have been part of NLP projects, Computer vision projects and sound processing projects. I also used ML for solving different company problems as attrition predic- tion. I would like to keep improving and developing my data science and artificial intelligence skills to use them for different projects in the future.</p>


<p class="mb-5"> I am open to opportunities every time. Don't hesitate in contact me</p>
