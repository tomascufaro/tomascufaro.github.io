<p>Vibration inherently exists within human life. In each process of our environment vibration are involved. Wave phenomena is pretty related to vibration. Understanding wave phenomena trough vibration and how can we use this info as descriptor are the main goals of this work </p>

<p>Mechanics vibration measurement, study purpose of this project, might be a important tool for industry development. For instance each machine that has an engine present a rotatory system that generates vibration. Those vibration can be usually described as oscillations.

The properties of the mathematical representation of the oscillations might change due to a modifications in the system. This would let us understand if  </p>

<p>Low cost and open source measurement system was developed as a prove of concept<p>

<p>The idea was to probe that vibration over a oscillation system could be measured and study aiming to improve the behavior of the system</p>

<p>In a real case scenario this measurements would let us improve the system functionality or even detect anomalies and fails</p>

<p>The equipment used consisted on a RaspberryPi 3 and a mpu650 sensor </p>

<p>The software used can be found in <a href="https://github.com/tomascufaro/mechanic_vibration_analyser">github</a> </p>
